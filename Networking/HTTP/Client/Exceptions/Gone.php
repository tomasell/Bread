 *
 * Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be
 * available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally
 * removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code,
 * the client should not request the resource again in the future. Clients such
 * as search engines should remove the resource from their indices. Most use
 * cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a
 * "404 Not Found" may be used instead.
